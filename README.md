# Practice CSS Examples

    This project is a collection of different css attempts at making various things (cards, site layouts, etc) along with learning important css topics (positioning, grid, flex, etc) in order to improve my overall understanding of css. This file will be updated periodically and this README will be updated with my findings from doing each project. All projects built within this collection are educational use only.


## Cobra Kai Grid
    
    This project is meant to build a grid layout using a topic of interest and have it be responsive on mobile and handle landscape view. The layout uses the grid display and puts each character in a rows of 4 characters each. If the screen is downsized to mobile, the characters are stacked into one column.
