# Practice CSS Examples

    This project is a collection of different css attempts at making various things (cards, site layouts, etc) along with learning important css topics (positioning, grid, flex, etc) in order to improve my overall understanding of css. This file will be updated periodically and this README will be updated with my findings from doing each project.
